# ProsparityAI - AI-Powered Sales Call Assistant

## Problem Statement

In today's competitive business landscape, sales teams face several critical challenges:

1. **Inefficient Lead Qualification**: Sales representatives spend significant time on initial calls with leads who may not be qualified or interested, leading to wasted effort and resources.

2. **Inconsistent Follow-up**: Important follow-up actions and key insights from sales calls often get lost or delayed due to manual note-taking and inconsistent follow-up processes.

3. **Limited Data-Driven Insights**: Sales teams lack comprehensive analytics about their call performance, common objections, and lead qualification patterns, making it difficult to optimize their sales strategies.

4. **Resource Intensive Training**: New sales representatives require extensive training to handle various customer scenarios and objections effectively, leading to longer ramp-up times.
